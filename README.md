# An Empirical Comparison of Machine Learning Models to Identify Parkinsonian Gaits

This works have been analyzed the Parkinsonian gaits using 5 different machine learnig algorithms.

1. Artificial neural networks.

2. Decision trees and random forest.

3. K-nearest neighbour. 

4. Logistic regression.

5. Support vector machines.  

All the algorithms are trained using 70% of the data with selecting the random_state as 5. The performances of the models are verified using 30% of testing data.
